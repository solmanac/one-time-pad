# one-time-pad
This is a secret splitting variant of the one time pad in which the pad is generated at the same time as the message.
Enter the results of a coin flip for each bit of the binary ascii of the message, eight coin flips per ascii character.
Can be used as a password manager where you keep both the generated pad and cipher but in seperate places.
Each cipher and pad bit could be assigned to a courier and reassembled on delivery. So for a single ascii character 
you would have eight coin flips and sixteen couriers.
